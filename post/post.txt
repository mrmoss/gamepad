##Drill and Tap

Drill out the screws holes with the 4-40 drill bit.

Tap the screws holes with the 4-40 tap. Do this slow, and remember that you're making threads here, so back out the bit.

You can drill and tap the back plate screw holes if you wish, or over drill them such that the screws just fall through. Either way works!

##Buttons

I'm not 100% happy with this system...but it works... Glue the columns to the back plate and then the buttons to the columns. Slow and steady here. I experimented with the directions of the buttons, I prefer the style on the left side of the picture above. The right side works, but you need extra wire between each of the buttons. I ended up changing the right side to match the left side.

Before moving on, put the top plate on and make sure they still click.

##Main Board

Glue on the Feather. That's a terrible picture...if only I could retake it...

Before moving on, make sure the USB lines up with the hole on the top piece.

##Wiring

Start with the buttons. Bend the inner legs in a ring like so. Solder them together.

Glue down your joysticks (the Adafruit ones go directly on the corners, the Sparkfun ones you'll have to eyeball. Now for the soldering. I started with the with the joysticks (blue and yellow wires). Then the buttons (white wires). There's only one ground and power, but you can get three more ground from the sides of the USB connector and the battery connector.

##Switch and Battery

The last thing to put on is the power switch and battery (in that exact order). Fit the switch in the top plate.

Solder the switch to ground and EN, and then hot glue it in.

Hot glue the battery onto the top plate. Plug it in. I'd recommend testing the electronics as you go.

##Firmware Test
Before closing up, upload the [testing firmware](https://github.com/mrmoss/gamepad/blob/master/firmware/tester/tester.ino). This will spit out the joysticks and buttons to the the Arduino serial monitor. Test all of the axes and buttons before closing up.

##Closing

Screw the back plate onto the top plate.

##Real Firmware
